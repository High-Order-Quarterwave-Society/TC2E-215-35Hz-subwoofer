# Type C2E-215-subwoofer
Paraflex dual 15" subwoofer

The TC2E-215 subwoofer was originaly designed by Matthew Morgan J. member of the **Higher Order Quarterwave Society** (HOQWS) which was started back in 2013 by Matthew Morgan J, Dustin Morgan (Flex Tech Designs) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts) 

# About Paraflex
The TC2E-215 subwoofer is based on a low and high tuned resonator making the design very efficient in it's bandwidth, therefore the named **Paraflex** was chosen. Many prototypes and design revisions have been made by members of the HOQWS, continualy improving the design of the cabinet and its different versions.

With a 35hz tuning (Fb), extreme combined power handling, more combined motor force than almost any 18" an more combined cone area equivalent to a 21" driver but far stronger. All within the same outer dimensions as our Type C-2E 1x18 cabinet. Modeled around the B&C 15NW100 in these sims the cabinet shows a -3db point of 35Hz, sensitivity @ 2.83v in half space @1M is 107 dBSPL on average with 110dB peaks at 80Hz. Driven at 100v you can expect 136-140db within it's pass-band from a single cabinet in Halfspace. Size and weight come in at 1219 x 865 x 611, 644L Gross, 517L Net, and 85.10KG/187Lbs (Calculated, Unloaded). Also included here is a modification to extend the low frequency to 32hz fb by reducing the mouth size thus extending the LF path.

# Working range
Recommended filters for this subwoofer are a 27hz 4th order Highpass filter (24dB/BW HPF), and 90Hz lowpass filter LPF (24dB/BW LPF), this design also exhibits extended upper bandwidth which may prove useful up to and maybe past 180hz, so it may be used in a system without kickbins. We encourage the user to adjust the frequency range and filter based on their application.

Other designs using the Paraflex principles where made for subwoofer and infrasonic frequency ranges. There are always new concepts and designs in progress on the [HOQWS facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bassaz/).
