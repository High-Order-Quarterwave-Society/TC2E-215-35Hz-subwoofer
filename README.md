# TC2E-215-subwoofer
Paraflex dual 15" subwoofer

The TC2E-215 subwoofer was originaly designed by Matthew Morgan J. member of the **Higher Order Quarterwave Society** (HOQWS) which was started back in 2013 by Matthew Morgan J, Dustin Morgan (Flex Tech Designs) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts) 

The TC2E-215 subwoofer is based on a low and high tuned resonator making the design very efficient in it's bandwidth, therefore the named **Paraflex** was chosen. Many prototypes and design revisions have been made by members of the HOQWS, continualy improving the design of the cabinet and its different versions.

Other designs using the Paraflex principles where made for subwoofer and infrasonic frequency ranges. There are always new concepts and designs in progress on the [HOQWS facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bassaz/).
